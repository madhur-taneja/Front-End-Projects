# Feed Reader Testing

* In this project, we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We were provided with [Jasmine Github respository](http://jasmine.github.io/) with an application with an incomplete test suite. We have to complete those suites.

* New test suites were built according to specifications provided and initial resources were tested using Jasmine. It can be found in my [Github Repository](https://github.com/madhur-taneja/Front-End-Projects) having folder `Feed Reader Testing`.

### Steps to open and run the app:

* Download the `.zip` file provided.
* Open `index.html` from the main folder.
* Check if all test cases are running. If yes, no error will be displayed.
* Comments in `app.js` and `feedreader.js` will help you out to go-through the code.
* Access `feedreader.js` in `spec` folder in `jasmine` folder.
