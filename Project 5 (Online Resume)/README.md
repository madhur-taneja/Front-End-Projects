# Online Resume

* I built my resume by writing JavaScript that combined my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.
* I used basic JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating data, building loops and creating functions. At the same time, I also used some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build my resume the moment a user opens the website.
