# Online Resume

* I built my resume by writing JavaScript that combined my personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate my resume.
* I used basic JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating data, building loops and creating functions. At the same time, I also used some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build my resume the moment a user opens the website.
* Open and view the Project using the .zip file provided or at my [Github Repository](https://github.com/madhur-taneja/Front-End-Projects/tree/master/Project%205%20(Online%20Resume)) having folder `Online Resume`.
* The project is also hosted [here](https://madhur-taneja.github.io/Front-End-Projects/Project%205%20(Online%20Resume)/index.html).
