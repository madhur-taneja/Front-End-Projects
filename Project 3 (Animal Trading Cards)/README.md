## Project Summary

This is a common workflow for front-end web developers. Typically, developers are provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website. In most cases, designers only provide the developers with the design prototype. However, for this project, Udacity has provided the design prototype and the HTML. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film. I've created a card and swapping out the fish with an animal of my choice.

## Getting Started

The primary task is to try and make the animal card resemble what you see in the [design-prototype.jpg]. The `card.html` was needed to be modified to include attributes and use CSS selectors to style specific elements.

The starter code can be found in [Udacity's Repository]

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the project [rubric]
