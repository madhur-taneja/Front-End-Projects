Web development is a very important thing in todays world. Most of the works in offices are now done on computers and web pages are also used for the same.
So, web development is now a necessity. And not only its easy, but also fun to do. I have been doing my web development projects for many hours straight now 
and I'm hardly tired. Web development can be pursued by any age group. It's building up my confidence because I'm able to see positive results.

I've learned html as a new skill. I'm able to create webpages from mere images or pdfs given to me.

Almost everything has been easy till now.

The only thing difficult that I found was that in the beginning was that the udacity front-end feedback extension wasn't giving the feedback. 
And I was not able to figure out what I had to do in those lessons. Eventually, the extension worked and gave a code that I used to complete those quizzes.

Till now, I haven't been in such a big trouble that I have to use any of those strategies.
