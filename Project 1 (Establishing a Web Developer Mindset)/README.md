# Establishing a Web Developer Mindset

* In this project, I have submitted a letter to my future self in basic HTML syntax describing how I can overcome any challenge ahead in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, and set some goals for what I want to achieve. I also learned how to get feedback from Udacity Project Reviewers.
