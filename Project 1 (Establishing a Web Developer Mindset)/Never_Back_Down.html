Hey! Heard you've been in some trouble lately. Stuck with something? Don't 
worry its gonna be alright. I know you'll make it through. Just stay calm. 
<q>Calma amigo</q> . Haha. <b>Relax</b>. Take a small break maybe and start 
working again with a fresh mind. Remember, we have had problems before and 
we have made through them. Be confident about your knowledge and yourself. 
Just be yourself man. First, try to solve the problem on your own. If its 
not working out, then seek some help from google. <i>Google baba</i> knows 
almost everything. If its still not enough then call the close friends or 
the cousins. I'm sure you'll be having your solution by the time you do 
this. 

<br><em>I am a hard working guy, who is smart,sensible and focused. So are 
you. And these traits are enough for tackling any obstacle.</em>

<br>

And having a growth mindset is helpful because you always try for 
betterment. Its easier to reach one's goals with this kind of mindset. 
Remember, never settle for mediocrity. Grow everyday. Be a better version 
of you. And <strong>just do it ;-)</strong>
