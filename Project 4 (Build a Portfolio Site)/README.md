# Building a Portfolio Website

* I developed a responsive portfolio website that displays images, descriptions and links using HTML, CSS and Twitter's Bootstrap CSS Framework.
* I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I replicated that design.
* Open and view the Project using the .zip file provided or at my [Github Repository](https://github.com/madhur-taneja/Front-End-Projects/tree/master/Project%204%20(Build%20a%20Portfolio%20Site)) having folder `Building a Portfolio Website`.
* The project is also hosted [here](https://madhur-taneja.github.io/Front-End-Projects/Project%204%20(Build%20a%20Portfolio%20Site)/Index.html).
