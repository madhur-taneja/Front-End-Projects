# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
* I was provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.
* The aim of this project was to use `Object-Oriented Programming`, an important programming paradigm that influences application's architecture and provides performance optimization.

## Steps to get the game:
1. Download `Project 6 (Classic Arcade Game Clone)` folder from my [Github Repository](https://github.com/madhur-taneja/Front-End-Projects) or unzip the `.zip` file that I've provided you.
2. The project is also hosted [here](https://madhur-taneja.github.io/Front-End-Projects/Project%206%20(Classic%20Arcade%20Game%20Clone)/index.html).

## Steps to run the game:
1. Open the main folder.
2. Open index.html.

### Game controls:
1. Up key - Move player towards goal.
2. Down key - Move player away from goal.
3. Left key - Move player to left.
4. Right key - Move player to right.

### Game Rules:
* Avoid Enemies using given controls and reach the finish line.

Good luck !
